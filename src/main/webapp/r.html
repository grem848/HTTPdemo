        <h2>You got redirected to me</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Observations:</h3>
        <br>
        I see the servlet and it's request, then a response that redirects to r.html
        <br>
        Then on r.html I see it requests the html in /HTTP/r.html
        <br>
        <br>
        For studypoints.dk, I see a request for http//:studypoints.dk, that is internally redirected
        <br>
        to https//:studypoints.dk
        <br>
