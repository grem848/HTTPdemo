        <h1>Understanding Basic Network Terms</h1>
        <br>
        1. What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?
        <br>
        93.163.28.15 googled it
        <br>
        <br>
        2. What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?
        <br>
        192.168.1.18 ipconfig in cmd
        <br>
        <br>
        3. What’s special about these address ranges? 
        <br>
        10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
        <br>
        172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 
        <br>
        92.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
        <br>
        Private IP addresses ipv4
        <br>
        <br>
        4. What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?
        <br>
        Localhost, local current pc
        <br><br>
        5. What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22(SSH), 23(Telnet), 25(SMTP), 53(DNS), 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS)? 
        <br><br>
        6. What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?
        <br>
        165.227.137.75 cmd nslookup studypoints.dk
        <br><br>
        7. If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
        <br>
        DNS server translation
        <br><br>
        8. Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both: 
        <br>
        IP address is a host identifier, provides location of host.
        <br>
        Port specifies the used server program
        <br><br>
        9. What is your (nearest) DNS server?
        <br>
        I use a manual DNS (1.1.1.1) because my ISP has a horrible one, but at school we use efif.dk as a standard
        <br><br>
        10. What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?
        <br>
        DNS translates a website path into an IP address, example andreasheick.dk to 46.101.104.53. Makes it easy to find websites
        <br><br>
        11. What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?
        <br>
        192.168.1.1 cmd ipconfig
        <br><br>
        12. What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?
        <br>
        192.168.1.1 cmd ipconfig
        <br><br>
        13. Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack
        <br>
        Works as the transportation layer of a connection, divides data into packages. Handles host-to-host
        <br><br>
        14. Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
        <br>
        HTTP is a web protocol, with a set of rules, used to fetch resources like html. Part of the application layer
        <br><br>
        15. Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
        <br>
        HTTP is the actual content, where the lower layers do transportation and communication.
        <br>
        Data coded according to application layer protocols are encapsulated into a transport layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP),
        <br>
        which in turn use lower layer protocols to effect actual data transfer.
