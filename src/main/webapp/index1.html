        <h3>Observations:</h3>
        <br>
        I see a request that gets index1.html, and which is the host,
        <br>
        information about browser and language and so on.
        <br>
        I see a stylesheet and image, and info about them.
        <br>
        <br>
        General header:
        <br>
        Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.
        <br>
        <br>
        Request header: 
        <br>
        Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.
        <br>
        <br>
        Response header:
        <br>
        Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name and version etc.).
